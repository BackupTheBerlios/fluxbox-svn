--------- Code:
* Check FluxboxWindow::toggleDecor
  Needs cleaning and check functions that uses this one. Should function 
  struct really be affected by this function.
* Fix some kind of "global" double click interval.  see IntResMenuItem.cc

--------- Features:
* you type a key and then you have a little menu which lets you 
  choose a window to group with the one where you are
* Finnish (Finland) translation
* "Iconify group"/group commands in Windowmenu
* Call and navigate menus from the keyboard (bind a menu to a key
  and use arrows to navigate)
* Dynamic tag width. Currently I know of two options - constant width
  and dividing the full window width. I like it better when the width is
  enough to show all the title, as long as the aggregation of all tabs
  doesn't exceed the frame's width (see PWM for example)
* Unique names (e.g, the second xterm title will be "xterm <2>", as in
  emacs), needed for the next wish:
* "Goto Frame" as Emacs C-x b, that show completions in the bar
* mouse button configure
* better group handling - possibly a structure to hold information about a
  tabgroup, so you can set a win property with a unique identifier and
  ordering, so that groups can be reconstructed on restart, and also set
  on launch somehow. Possibly related would be fixing it so it remembers
  which member of a tabgroup is the focused one, and set that
  appropriately when necessary (eg currently, unsticking a group will
  revert the focus to the "first" window in the group, instead of the
  focused one).




Next Generation:
* Rewrites:
  - Menu
  - Toolbar
  - Signal system
