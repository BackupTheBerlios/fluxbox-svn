A new kind of mode: "keep on head"
Which states all newly created windows should be placed on a specific head.


Action: Move all ( or one specific ) windows from one head to another.
This is usefull if a head is disabled for some reason. 


Focus cycling: Cycle through heads focusables.
Which heads focusables should be be in the focus cycle should be determined by
mouse position ( kind of "sloppy focus" ) or a "fixed" boolean variable set
through setresource command.
