* Screen.cc:
	fix toupper for str_key in in Menu loading
	nls for "error on row" in Menu loading ?? 
* remove cyclic deps:
	Tab <-> Window
	Workspace <-> Window
	and more 
* Fix "no font" crash
* Fix configurable toolbar
  so the user can configure toolbar in a config file
* Toolbar shouldn't hide if its autohide and 
  you are in "change workspace mode"
* The BadAccess error in Theme
* Finnish (Finland) translation
* Wheel-config support
* Separator in the menus
* More Gnome atom support 
* Net wm atom support
* Clean up in the global namespace
* Create fbinput style app
* Add wheelscroll-workspace-change configuration (reversed order or
  regular)
* Add "system menu" for minimized apps in the icon bar.
  (Close, Kill, Send to, etc)	
* "Iconify group"/group commands in Windowmenu
* Call and navigate menus from the keyboard (bind a menu to a key
  and use arrows to navigate)
* Dynamic tag width. Currently I know of two options - constant width
  and dividing the full window width. I like it better when the width is
  enough to show all the title, as long as the aggregation of all tabs
  doesn't exceed the frame's width (see PWM for example)
* Unique names (e.g, the second xterm title will be "xterm <2>", as in
  emacs), needed for the next wish:
* "Goto Frame" as Emacs C-x b, that show completions in the bar
  (I really like the emacs's "ido.el" package behavior, which I recommend
   to any emacs user)
* mouse button configure
