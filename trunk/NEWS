News in 0.1.11:
   * Autogrouping:
      This will read groups from a file and auto group programs when
      they start.
   * Autogrouping-from-tab:
      This will allow you to popup the root menu, if you right click on the tab,
      and select an application and it'll start grouped to the tab.
      (note: this might interfere with the normal autogrouping in a bad way)
   * Two new themes: BlueNight and LemonSpace
   * Carry window across workspace with outlined mode.
   * Slit now has a theme option:
      slit: <texture option>
      slit.color: <color value>
      slit.colorTo: <color value>
      It will fall back to the toolbar theme if it doesn't find it.
   * ja_JP and fr_FR in fluxbox-generate_menu
   * New util: fbrun
      Which allows you to type a command and run it.
   * The window menu now pop up in iconbar when you right click on the icon.
