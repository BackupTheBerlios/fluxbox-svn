News in 0.9.10:
    * Keybindings for directional focus movement:
      * key actions:
        FocusUp, FocusDown, FocusLeft, FocusRight
    * Added apps file matching on WM_WINDOW_ROLE (Simon)
      * use "role=string". Particularly useful for gaim+gimp windows
       [app] (role=buddy_list) ...
    * Window menu file
      * new resource:
        * session.screen<num>.windowMenu: <filename>
      * The menu file format is the same as the normal ~/.fluxbox/menu
        but with some special menu items:
        [iconify], [maximize], [shade], [close], [extramenus]
        [layer], [sendto]
        + the all the other menu items that you can use in the normal
        root menu (i.e [exec] (aterm) {aterm})
        The [extramenus] will add  "remember" menu
        example: session.screen0.windowMenu: ~/.fluxbox/windowmenu
        [begin]
          [exec] (aterm) {aterm}
          [maximize]
          [shade]
          [close]
        [end]
    * New actions:
      * exit  (exit fluxbox, new to keybinding)
    * Improved menu transparent rendering speed and the 
      text is not transparent anymore so you are able
      to see the text even if you have 100% transparency
    * New menu theme items:
      * menu.titleHeight: <integer>
      * menu.itemHeight: <integer>
      The height of the item/title will be the biggest of
      font height + bevel and the specified height, so the
      text will always fit.
    * Added icons in menu and improved menu loading speed
      * New option for menu file:
       [key] (label) {argument to key} <the icon filename>
       example:
       [exec] (aterm) {aterm} <terminal.xpm>
    * Improve rendering speed of toolbar
    * Supports _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DESKTOP
      * eg nautilus desktop windows are on the bottom, not tabable, etc
    * Added some new options font loading:
      *.font:  fontname-size:option,specoption1:key=val;key2=val2 etc
      eg:
      *.font: Verdana-10:bold,shadow:offsetx=2;offsety=4;color=green
      *.font: Verdana-10:halo:color=blue
      possible specoptions atm:
      halo:
        color=colorname
      shadow:
        color=colorname
        offsetx=number  (negative allowed)
        offsety=number  (negative allowed)
    * Fixed so one can use to use this in the apps-file:
      [Layer] {number | literal}
      ex:
	  [Layer] {BOTTOM}
      while literal is one of
      DESKTOP BOTTOM NORMAL TOP DOCK ABOVEDOCK MENU
    * fluxbox-generate_menu:
      * Preliminary basic support for icons in fluxbox-generate_menu (Han)
        * put a <progname>.xpm into ~/.fluxbox/icons. e.g. Eterm.xpm

    * Compiles with gcc 3.4
    * Reparent issue with java menus
    * A crash when a window closes while [opaque] moving
    * Rendering of transparency on menu exposes 
    * handling alpha value of zero
    * Bug in Iconbar mode menu
    * Bug in systray (Henrik)
      (this fixes the problem with "sim" in systray)
      It didn't force client position on configure request
    * Tiled texture
    * Transient window bug at startup
    * Ugly toolbar at startu
    * When time_t is long long 
    * Delete key is working for fbrun
