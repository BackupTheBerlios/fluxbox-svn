   * Added new commands:
     * ToggleCmd
       Works like a macro but executes the commands one at the time in order.
       Example:
       Mod1 T :ToggleCmd {Exec xterm} {NextWindow}
       When Mod1 T is press the first time it will start xterm, the second time
       it will do NextWindow. When it reaches end it will start at the beginning.
     * CloseAllWindows
       Closes all windows.
   * Supports urgency hint ( flashing titlebar/iconbar )
   * Pressing shift while pressing enter in menu item will fake a right mouse
     button press. Useful for increase/decrease values in menu.
   * Updated documentation
   * Flashing titlebar/iconbar when the window depamands attention with urgency 
     hint or using _NET_WM_STATE_DEMANDS_ATTENTION.
     The blink rate can be configured with the following resource:
     session.screen0.demandsAttentionTimeout: <timeout in milliseconds>
     Default value is 500.
     If the value is zero this feature will be disabled.
   * Better UTF-8 handling
   * fbrun: Move the cursor to the end when tab completing
     (rfe #1333003, patch #1475578)
   * Added option to reverse desktop wheeling (patch #1034287)
     session.screen0.reversewheeling: true|false
   * Vertical toolbar is back.
   * Provide "Key Modes"
     - New action in keys file:
         Modifier Key :Keymode <Name> <End Modifier> <End Key>
       Will define a keybinding namespace activated by the given mod/key 
       combination. The End Modifier and key are optional. They define 
       the key combination that quits the given key mode. They default 
       to just 'Escape'.
     - New keys file optional prefix:
         <Name>: Modifier Key :Command
       will only work when the <Name> keymode is activated.
     - <Name> is  "default" if not specified - so:
        **default commands will not be activated inside another keymode**
     - Handy Example:
        Mod1 X :KeyMode XNest
        XNest: Mod1 X :KeyMode default
       Will switch to XNest keymode when you press Alt-X. Then the 
       default bindings will not be caught by normal fluxbox, and will 
       pass through to an Xnested one! Groovy... Alt-X will switch back 
       to normal.
