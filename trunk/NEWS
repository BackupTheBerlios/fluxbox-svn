News for 0.1.9:
  * Improved fluxbox-generate_menu script.
    Which now installs itself so you can regenerate the menu any time,
    and with gnome and kde menus
	run: fluxbox-generate_menu -h
	for more information.
  * Default 24 hour clock format
  * Code cleaning
  * Compiles with no errors on Mac OS X
  * Now compiles with Intel Compiler 6.0 and GCC 3.1    
  * New keybindings:
    * FirstTab
       Go to first tab
    * LastTab
       Go to last tab
    * MoveTabPrev
       Move current tab left
    * MoveTabNext
       Move current tab right
  * "Allow Desktop MouseWheel Switching" runtime option
  * Configurable geometry show
    configure in init with: session.screen0.showwindowposition
  * Now saves resources when you change them in the menu and not when you
    exit Fluxbox. So you can edit the init file and the reconfigure/restart 
    Fluxbox to activate changes.

Bugfixes:
  * bug [ 552723 ] removing decorations while shaded.
  * shade bug while vertical rotated tabs and tabs off 
  * bug [ 515483 ] "XMMS Problem"
  * Fixed transient bug which cause Fluxbox to crach ( the "acroread" bug )
