News in 0.9.15:
    * Added styleOverlay resource 
          session.styleOverlay: ~/.fluxbox/overlay
        Style settings in this file override any settings from a
        regular style
    * New theme item:
          background: <texture option>
          background.pixmap: <image filename>
          background.color: <color>
          background.colorTo: <color>
        The background.pixmap filename will be sent to "fbsetbg"
        which in turn sets the background.
        The following options will be available for the background.pixmap:
           - tiled 
           - centered
        For example:
          background: tiled
          background.pixmap: someimage.png
        and it can also generate a normal texture:
          background: gradient
          background.color: blue
          background.colorTo: green
        The rootCommand in the style is now obsolete and if the 
        "background" item is not found in the style then the default
        background will be green and with a warning text.
    * Added new resize mode: Center 
        Example session.screen0.resizeMode: Center
        This mode will move all corners at the same time with 
        equal distance.
    * nls changes:
       * Updated ko_KR
       * Added zh_CN, nb_NO
