# don't use $(), use ``

# don't use id -u, use whoami
# getopts won't work on all platforms, but the config-file can

    -f  Set fullscreen wallpaper
    -c  Set centered wallpaper
    -t  Set tiled wallpaper
    -a  Set maximized wallpaper, preserving aspect.
        ( if your bgsetter doesn't support this
          fbsetbg falls back to -f )

    -h  Display this help

    -l  Set previous wallpaper

    -d  Debug fbsetbg
    -T  Tips

To replace all occurances of bsetbg in a file use this command:

  perl -pi -e 's,([^f]|^)bsetbg,fbsetbg,'

If you want the style to set the wallpaper and you want fbsetbg to
remember the previous wallpaper put this in your ~/.fluxbox/init

  session.screen0.rootCommand:    fbsetbg -l

I Can't find and app to set the wallpaper with. You can install one in
many many ways but I will give you some simple advice: install Eterm and
your set. Eterm provides Esetroot and thats a great wallpapersetter. I
recommend you install the package provided by your distro.
