The coding style is almost the same as i blackbox.
Instead of 2 spaces there is tab.
Use a tab size of 2 or 4 and you will be fine.

if-statements:

	if ( stuff ) 
		function(stuff, more stuff, 
			more, even more);
	else
		morefunction( stuff, more stuff
			stuff, 
			stuff,
			stuff);
			
if the functionline needs to be split up, like above, right after an if-statement
use { and }, so its clear when the if-statement ends.
It should look like this

	if ( stuff ) {
		function(stuff, more stuff, 
			more, even more);
	} else {
		morefunction( stuff, more stuff
			stuff, 
			stuff,
			stuff);
	}
	
If a line need to be splited in an if-statement then it should use two 
tab for indent next row in if-statement like this:

	if ( longline && longline && longling &&
			longline && longline && longline)
		funktion();

The include guards:
FILENAME_HH


Function comments:
//------------ function name --------
// This do that and that
// Returns this on success else
// this on failure.
// TODO: if there is something to do.
//-----------------------------------
type classname::function(...) {

}


enums must be in uppercase letters and not in file scope:
enum {WHITE, RED, BLUE};

Class data members are prefixed by m_ 
Class member function will be organized accordning to creator, 
manipulator and accessor categories.
