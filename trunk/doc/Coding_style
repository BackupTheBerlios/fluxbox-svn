The coding style is almost the same as i blackbox.
Instead of 2 spaces there is tab.
It might look strange now in some places, that is because
the code hasnt been "translated" to tab 100% yet.
Use a tab size of 2 and you will be fine.

if-statements:

	if ( stuff ) 
		function(stuff, more stuff, 
			more, even more);
	else
		morefunction( stuff, more stuff
			stuff, 
			stuff,
			stuff);
			
if the functionline needs to be split up, like above, right after an if-statement
use { and }, so its clear when the if-statement ends.
It should look like this

	if ( stuff ) {
		function(stuff, more stuff, 
			more, even more);
	} else {
		morefunction( stuff, more stuff
			stuff, 
			stuff,
			stuff);
	}
	

The include guards:
_FILENAME_HH_ 


Function comments:
//------------ function name --------
// This do that and that
// Returns this on success else
// this on failure.
// TODO: if there is something to do.
//-----------------------------------
type classname::function(...) {

}


enums must be in uppercase letters:
enum {WHITE, RED, BLUE};
