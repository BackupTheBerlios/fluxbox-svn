I would also like to thank the creators of WindowMaker.  Reading the existing
code has helped me immensely, and the BImage class follows the RImage data type
very closely (the 8bpp code and dithering code was based off of WindowMaker's
wrlib).

I recently stumbled upon a library called ccmalloc (which is included in the
source tarball with blackbox) that has helped me immensely.  Many thanks to
Armin Biere <armin@ira.uka.de> for this debugging aid.
