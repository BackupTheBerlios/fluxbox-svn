Known bugs and missing features that will be fixed in future version:

bugs:

* Window handle is invisible sometimes
* It maximize over everything
* Some menus doesn't close when you click on items
* Transient windows seem to not have a X border - is this right?
* saving of number of workspaces on restart

fixed bugs (or not-our-fault bugs):
* Some people get weird transparency behaviour.
  -> this appears to be a problem with nvidia drivers, try nv instead
