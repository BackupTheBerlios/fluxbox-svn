Known bugs and missing features that will be fixed in future version:

BUGS:

  * Some builds/distros seem to require all supported locales to be 
    installed to build properly (e.g. mdk, gentoo reported), this ok?

  * Icons menu isn't in Workspaces menu

  * Window handle is invisible sometimes.

  * Default style stuff is completely broken (e.g. try breaking the path to 
    your styleFile in init file)
    => I also couldn't see an error about that, but maybe it got lost in 
       debug output? Check that too.

  * Some menus don't close when you click on items.

  * Transparancy for the slit does not always work right.
    => is this fixed now?? (as of ResourceManager changes)

  * After startup the font of the toolbar is to big; reload config works
    around this.
    => is this fixed now?? (as of ResourceManager changes)
    => Don't think so, extra info = seems to happen for Multiple screens

  * Saving of number of workspaces on restart

  * gaim (0.64) crashes when remembering dimensions... is this a gaim
    bug?

  * Workspace switching extremely slow in some cases. Particularly, user
    has large number of [remote] xload windows.

  * Can lock up on workspace change - possibly related to above as it
    works when there aren't too many xload windows started up yet.

  * Remember-patch grouping can change order on each restart. Need to
    turn off remember functionality when restarting (only use it for
    first instance).

Other TODO:

FAQ items for:

  * "My window (e.g. mplayer/xmms) stops updating when I move
    windows around"
    - outline moving does this, it's not a bug, etc etc.


Fixed bugs (or not-our-fault bugs):
  * KDE dockapp support (e.g klipper)
    => fixed

  * Some people get weird transparency behaviour:
    - this appears to be a problem with nvidia drivers, make sure
      RenderAccel is off (Option "RenderAccel" "false"). (thanks RJNFC
      on #fluxbox, and barlad in gentoo forums)

  * Disabling full-maximize doesn't work (fixed in cvs).

  * Workspace1... Workspace12 are disabled

  * MoveTab* actions are disabled

  * Transient windows seem to not have a X border - is this right?
    => no, they ought to have a border

  * Slit (check toolbar too) layernum isn't initialised to resource 
    value on init. Also check why Fluxbox::Layer is used rather than int.
    => Fixed by reorganising the way ResourceManager works.
       Fluxbox::Layer is used so that we can give some layers names

  * MenuAlpha (at least) isn't 'per-screen' - takes the value of the
    highest numbered screen.
    => Fixed, moved alpha setting into MenuTheme rather than static value

  * Remember menu sometimes isn't present in window menu. Probably need
    to add a signal for menu reconfigures (Screen::setupWindowActions)
    => Fixed, added "ExtraMenus" for windows that get added whenever it
       is rebuilt.

  * If you toggle a setting in the configuration-menu the notch does not
    indicate the change until you point to another option.
    => Fixed

  * Multiple transients:
    in openoffice - focus jumps between until user does something
    in mozilla    - alt-tabbing does strange thigns with other transient
                    layer-wise (other transient flashes)
    => fixed
