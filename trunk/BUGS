Known bugs and missing features that will be fixed in future version:

bugs:

* MenuAlpha (at least) isn't 'per-screen' - takes the value of the highest 
  numbered screen.
* Window handle is invisible sometimes.
* KDE support needs attention (e.g. klipper).
* Some menus don't close when you click on items.
* Transparancy for the slit does not always work right.
* After startup the font of the toolbar is to big; reload config works 
  around this.
* Transient windows seem to not have a X border - is this right?
* saving of number of workspaces on restart
* multiple transients -> in openoffice - focus jumps between until user 
                         does something
                      -> in mozilla - alt-tabbing does strange thigns with 
                         other transient layer-wise (other transient flashes)
* gaim (0.64) crashes when remembering dimensions... is this a gaim bug?
* workspace switching extremely slow in some cases. Particularly, user has 
  large number of [remote] xload windows.
* Can lock up on workspace change - possibly related to above as it 
  works when there aren't too many xload windows started up yet.
* Remember-patch grouping can change order on each restart. Need to turn 
  off remember functionality when restarting (only use it for first 
  instance).

other todo:
FAQ items for:
 * "My window (e.g. mplayer/xmms) stops updating when I move windows 
    around" => outline moving does this, it's not a bug, etc etc.

fixed bugs (or not-our-fault bugs):
* toggle horz/vertical maximise should restore the orig value (fixed in cvs)
* Some people get weird transparency behaviour.
  -> this appears to be a problem with nvidia drivers, make sure
     RenderAccel is off (Option "RenderAccel" "false").
     (thanks RJNFC on #fluxbox, and barlad in gentoo forums)
* Disabling full-maximize doesn't work (fixed in cvs).
* Workspace1... Workspace12 are disabled
* MoveTab* actions are disabled
