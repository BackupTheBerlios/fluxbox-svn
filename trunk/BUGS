Known bugs and missing features that will be fixed in future version:

bugs:

* Window handle is invisible sometimes.
* Disabling full-maximize doesn't work.
* Some menus don't close when you click on items.
* Transparancy for the slit does not always work right.
* After startup the font of the toolbar is to big; reload config works around this.
* Transient windows seem to not have a X border - is this right?
* saving of number of workspaces on restart

fixed bugs (or not-our-fault bugs):
* Some people get weird transparency behaviour.
  -> this appears to be a problem with nvidia drivers, try nv instead
