Read NEWS to see whats new in this release.
For copyright see COPYING

Compile and Install:

# ./configure 
# make 
and then as root
# make install

for KDE slitsupport: (Allows kde tray icons to be placed in the fluxbox slit)
   ./configure --enable-kde
	 
For more information and FAQ go to http://fluxbox.sourceforge.net

To disable tabs and/or iconbar just  change it in configure menu.

To use your own configuration:
Create a directorory, in your homedir, called .fluxbox
and copy: init, titlebar and menu from fluxbox datapath.
Dont forget to change session.menuFile and session.titlebarFile
in the file init.

You can use your old blackbox configuration file too. Just copy
.blackboxrc to ~/.fluxbox/init . The same goes for menu file.
You can also use the Blackbox themes in Fluxbox.
If there isn't any format for the tab in the theme then
the tab will have the same theme as the titlebar.

The keys config file can be selected in the file init:
session.keyFile: <filename here>
The keys file is no longer compatible with bbkeys. There's a convertkeys
script at http://fluxbox.sourceforge.net/ that will convert the bbkeys
format to the fluxbox format.
 
 
A few extra notes:
 - To disable tabs and/or iconbar just change it in configure menu.
 - To work with tabs, use the third mouse button to drag a tab to another tab.
   This will group the two windows together.
 - With 'Sloppy Window Grouping' turned on (in your configure menu), you can
   drop the tabs anywhere on the target window to group windows together.
 - The 'Maximize Slit Stop' option means that maximized windows will stop at
   the outside border of the slit, keeping the slit in full view.
 - In the init file, the session.screen0.rootCommand: option will override
   the rootCommand option in a theme- keeping your background the same, no
   matter what the theme says it should be.
