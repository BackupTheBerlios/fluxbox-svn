Known bugs and missing features that will be fixed in future version:

BUGS:

  * Reported issues with gvim windows that have different sized fonts.
    -> Tabbing them together makes them fight over the window size, and
       thus shrink to minimum

  * Some builds/distros seem to require all supported locales to be
    installed to build properly (e.g. mdk, gentoo reported), this ok?

Other TODO:

FAQ items for:

  * "My window (e.g. mplayer/xmms) stops updating with non-opaque
    window moving.
    - outline moving does this, it's not a bug, etc etc.
