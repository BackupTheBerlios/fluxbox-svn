News in 1.0rc3:
    * Introduced support for mouse buttons in the keys file
      - Mouse buttons are bound to new `keys' Mouse1, Mouse2, etc.
      - Also a new modifier `OnDesktop' to specify actions that should take place
        when you click on the desktop -- without this, mouse bindings are global
    * Added a utility to the project that automatically updates configuration
      files when we change the syntax -- your current mouse bindings on the
      desktop will be added to your keys file automatically
    * Introduced new key command: HideMenus
    * Introduced a key command to display a menu stored in an arbitrary file:
      CustomMenu /path/to/file
    * More extended wm hints support:
      * _NET_WM_MOVERESIZE_CANCEL (new in version 1.4.draft-1),
      * _NET_REQUEST_FRAME_EXTENTS 
      * _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_MENU
      * _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_TOOLBAR
    * Little simplification of data structure for keybindings (Mark)
      Side effects:
        - "Mod4 a b" now behaves like "Mod4 a None b" -- in fact, "None" is now
           completely obsolete
        - You can press "Escape" to cancel any Emacs-style keychain in progress
          (unless it's bound to something else)
        - If there is a conflict between bindings, the first one in the file wins
        - Fixes handling of keychains like "Mod4 a Mod1 b"
        - Should fix some issues with "None" modifier  
    * Updated following translations:
      pt_PT, es_ES, es_AR, pt_BR, de_DE, nb_NO
    * Support per-window transparency settings.
       ( sf.net patch #1511042, feature #1108692 )
      - new "Transparency" menu in the window menu
      - new apps file attribute: 
         [alpha] {int int} (or just {int})
        Where numbers represent focused and unfocused transparency, 
        respectively. One number only will be used for both.
      - Also, show toggle status for shade and stick in window menu.
      * Introduced new key command: SetAlpha [[+-]<int> [[+-]<int>]]
        - with no arguments, returns the focused window to default settings
        - with one argument, changes both focused and unfocused settings the same
          way
        - with two arguments, the first changes the focused alpha, and the second
          changes the unfocused alpha
       E.g. SetAlpha 127 +5 will set the focused alpha to 127 and increment the
      unfocused alpha by 5 (until it reaches 255)
    
    * Added resource and menu item for maximizing over external tabs
    * Renamed session.screen*.iconbar.deiconifyMode to
       session.screen*.userFollowModel (Mark)
       This resource is used for:
        - clicking a window on a different workspace in the iconbar
        - _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW messages where the source is a pager
        - clicking a client in the workspace menu (and the opposite is used for
          right clicks)
       Possible values are:
        - Follow: go to the workspace of the selected window
        - Current: bring the window to the current workspace
        - SemiFollow: act like Current for iconified windows, else Follow
        - Ignore: leave it alone
    * Added support for negative arguments to the `Tab' key command to count
      backwards from the last tab in the group
    * Added option to :Minimize key command to lower all windows in the same
      layer as the focused window,syntax is :Minimize (layer)
    * Several changes for background style option:
      - now support `background: mod' to coincide with fbsetroot -mod --
        In addition to `background.color' and `background.colorTo', this option
        must also set `background.modX' and `background.modY' to integers
      - added `background: none' for styles that do not include a background
      - fixed bug with style backgrounds not getting set when changing styles
      - updated default styles to be valid wrt background options
    *  Made some changes to the way autogrouping in the apps file works
      - Introduced new syntax [group] (workspace) to group new windows only with
        windows on the current workspace.
    * XEMBED support for systemtray.
    * Added typeahead support to menus (patch by Philipp Goedl, modified by Mark
      and Matteo Galiazzo)
      - Added new style item menu.frame.underlineColor: <color> for displaying
        matching items
    * session.screen<N>.defaultDeco now allows same strings as apps file
