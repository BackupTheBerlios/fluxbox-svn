This file is intended to provide a rough roadmap of the development 
towards the Fluxbox 1.0.0 release.

The process will involve a number of development releases in the 0.9
series until features and execution (i.e. bugs) stabilise.

Some of the interesting new features beyond 0.1.14 that we'd like to work towards are:

- Layer Support
- New action system (key/mouse bindings)
- Tabgroup rewrite (should also allow more commands to act on the whole group)
- Tabs embedded in titlebar
- Most recently used window cycling
- Toolbar modes
- Integration of remember patch (or at least the concept)
- Smarter config menus (ability to modify numeric values)
- fix Xinerama support again

Some minor ones (mainly bugfixes or small things) that I feel like noting are
(many of these based on feature requests or bug reports from sourceforge):

- (optional) Unique per-workspace backgrounds
- Key bindings for:
  -> restart
  -> specific tab numbers
  -> tabgroup keybindings
  -> menu navigation
  -> moving windows to next workspace/tabgroup
- fix up focus issues (click to focus sometimes acts like sloppy)
- proper initialisation from hints (e.g. Eterm -D 2)
- fix toggledecoration to not give tabs back etc
- snap to windows
- Pixmap buttons
- Shaped menus/toolbar/slit
- improved command line output for help option (plus include compile-time options 
        etc in output for improved bug reporting)
- layer configuration things for toolbar/slit/numlayers
- fix outline window moving

Some lower priority ones ("thoughts"/maybes):

- transparency (major)
- keybindings for directional focus moving:
  -> nextWindowLeft/Right/Up/Down
     - looks for the window left of the current one, and gives it focus
- more powerful autogrouping matching
- stop window movement by clicking on border (only on frame instead)
- mouse button "keys"
- ability to specify keybinding actions for titlebar buttons (i.e. configurable actions for titlebar buttons).

Known Bugs (to be looked at at some time):
